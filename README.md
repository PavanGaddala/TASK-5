# TASK-5
Project Title:
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on Titanic Dataset

Objective:
The objective of this project is to perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the Titanic dataset using Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn) to extract meaningful insights, visualize relationships, identify trends, and understand survival patterns among passengers.

Files Included:
EDA_Titanic.ipynb → Jupyter Notebook with all analysis, code, and graphs.

EDA_Titanic.pdf → PDF version of the full report with observations.

Tools Used:
Google Colab (Python 3)

Libraries: Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn

Key Steps Performed:
Data Loading and Basic Information (.info(), .describe())

Handling missing values and data cleaning

Univariate analysis (histograms, value counts)

Bivariate and multivariate analysis (scatterplots, boxplots, heatmaps)

Visualizations to study survival rates based on gender, class, age, etc.

Summary of findings and observations.

Summary of Findings:
Females had a much higher survival rate compared to males.

First-class passengers survived more often than second or third-class passengers.

Younger passengers (ages 20–40) formed a majority, but children had relatively higher survival rates.

Higher fares were associated with better survival chances.

Missing values were mainly present in the Age and Cabin columns.
